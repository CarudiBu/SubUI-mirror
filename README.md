# SubUI-mirror
Mirror main phone screen to Z Flip3 Cover screen.

No app uninstalls or root required.

## How to use
Install the app, open it and hit 'Start' to start mirroring. 
Mirroring uses a lot of battery and processing power. 
Make sure to turn it off when not in use, or before closing the phone.
The front cover screen won't work while the phone is closed if mirroring is still running.

## Known issues
- The resolution of the content on the display is very low when cropping is on

## WIP
- [x] Basic mirroring
- [ ] Touch mirroring
- [ ] Auto-exit on phone closed
- [ ] Improved resolution when cropping is on
- [ ] Settings to control crop, tint, rotation and resolution
