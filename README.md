# SubUI-mirror
Mirror main phone screen to Z Flip3 Cover screen.

No app uninstalls or root required.

Install the app, open it and hit 'Start' to start mirroring. 
Mirroring uses a lot of battery and processing power. 
Make sure to turn it off when not in use, or before closing the phone.
The front cover screen won't work while the phone is closed if mirroring is still running.
